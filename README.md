# The Omega Beacon
A GregTech modern pack about uncovering a galaxy-defining mystery within the ruins of a lost world.

## Core ideas behind this pack:
- No magic mods, tech only.
- Story-heavy, with lore available in quests and worldgen.
- Difficult in both survival and tech, where resource scarcity expands to every aspect of gameplay in early game.
- This pack should not be a patterning simulator. Some processes are complex to automate.
- Dimension-wide or save-wide effects as progression milestones. **THIS PACK CAN NOT BE PLAYED BY SEPARATE TEAMS IN THE SAME WORLD.**
- Progression milestones that hinder you in some aspects. **Progressing might require you to lose something.**
